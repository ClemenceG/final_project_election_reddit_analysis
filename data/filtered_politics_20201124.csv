optimalg,"The ""What happened in your state last week?"" Megathread, Week 46","Welcome to the 'What happened in your state last week' thread, where you can post any local political news stories that you find important in the comments. This is a weekly thread posted every Monday, in order to facilitate more discussion on local issues on /r/politics. Since this is intended to be a thread about local politics, top-level comments that are exclusively about national issues will not be allowed. When commenting, please include the state you're living in, and don't forget to link sources. **Also, please actually describe what happened. ""I live in X, you know what happened"" isn't helpful to users and will be removed.**

If someone from your state made a news round-up that you think is insufficient, feel free to comment to that round-up with further news stories. Enjoy discussion, and review [our civility guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_please_be_civil) before engaging with others.

Hi there, /r/politics. Because this thread is about local politics, I'd like to reiterate **news about Trump, Biden or any other national political figure is off topic in this thread and will be removed**. Thank you, and have a good week."
PoliticsModeratorBot,Megathread: The GSA Has Informed President-Elect Joe Biden that the Administration is Ready to Begin the Formal Transition Process,"GSA head, Emily Murphy, has moved to officially begin transition and give President-Elect Joe Biden the resources to transition including $6.3 million.
