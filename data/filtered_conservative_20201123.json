The Mueller investigation had near unlimited subpoena powers https://heavy.com/news/2017/05/robert-mueller-special-prosecutor-counsel-what-powers-authority/

Including access to nearly all digital data (thanks to the NSA) https://www.foxnews.com/politics/exposure-of-nsa-surveillance-draws-attention-to-mueller-remark-about-real-time-email-tracking

Directly employed 19 lawyers, who were assisted by a team of about 40 FBI agents, intelligence analysts, forensic accountants and other professional staff. https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/mueller-investigation-numbers-days-witnesses

Issued more than 2,800 subpoenas and executed close to 500 search warrants.

https://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/susan-jones/you-paid-22-months-19-lawyers-40-fbi-2800-subpoenas-500-search-warrants-500

It took two years https://www.npr.org/2019/03/23/706143881/timeline-of-the-mueller-investigation

Cost (at least) $32 million https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/02/robert-muellers-russia-probe-cost-nearly-32-million-in-total-doj.html

But because you haven't seen conclusive evidence of fraud in a number of states in a matter of days it doesn't exist?

Sidney Powell has told us they are gathering the best evidence and will drop major lawsuits in the next two weeks. Light years faster than Mueller who every major media outlet told us we had to wait for ""because these things take time""
